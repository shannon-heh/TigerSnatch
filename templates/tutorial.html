                    Before you start Snatching for course spots, here’s a brief guide on how to use
                    TigerSnatch.

            <div class="row">
                <p class="fw-light text-center fs-5 p-text mb-4">
                    Toggle “Notify Me” switches to subscribe to (i.e. receive notifications for) or
                    unsubscribe from (i.e. stop receiving notifications for) full sections.
                </p>

            <div class="row">

                    If you're already enrolled in a full section but wish to switch into another, try out Trades. From the dropdown, select and save your currently enrolled section. 
                    Then, click Find Trades to view and email other Tigers who are in one of your subscribed sections 
                    and want to switch into your current section.

                    sections you wish to trade with other Tigers. <br />

                    It's that simple! The next time a spot opens up in a subscribed section, you'll be
                    notified immediately via email. You will continue receiving notifications every
                    5 minutes until this section is full again, or you unsubscribe from it. To
                    unsubscribe from a particular section, simply log back onto Tigersnatch and
                    toggle the section's switch off in the Dashboard.

                    By the way, every time a notification is sent for a newly available subscribed section or you
                    and another Tiger choose to contact one another to engage in a Trade, these 
                    actions will be logged on the Activity page for your covenience.

                    Note that Tigersnatch subscriptions are independent from official Registrar
                    waitlists. You might not be able to enroll in courses shown on TigerSnatch even
                    if spots free up. Always check Course Offerings for course-specific enrollment
                    info.
